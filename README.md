# Auth API — Node.js & Express

This is a simple **Auth API** built with **Node.js** and **Express**, created as part of my backend practice.  
It includes basic **GET** and **POST** routes, with simulated async responses using `Promises` and `setTimeout`.

## Features

- **GET `/all-users`** — Fetch all users  
- **GET `/random-user`** — Fetch a random user  
- **POST `/users`** — Create a new user (requires `name` and `email`)  

---
